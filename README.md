### Basic Server
    
Building a local server for a chat application involves creating a central point that can handle incoming connections, manage users, and relay messages between them. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you'd follow using Python's standard library:

1. **Set Up the Server Socket**: 
   - Use the `socket` library to create a socket that will listen for incoming connections.
   - Bind it to a local IP address (like `127.0.0.1`) and a port number.

2. **Listen for Incoming Connections**: 
   - Put the server socket into listening mode so that it can accept connections.
   - When a client connects, accept the connection and create a new socket specifically for that client.

3. **Handling Multiple Clients**: 
   - Use the `threading` or `asyncio` library to manage multiple connections so that the server can communicate with several clients simultaneously.
   - Each client connection should be handled in its own thread or asynchronous task to allow for concurrent processing.

4. **Managing Client Sessions**: 
   - Assign a unique identifier to each client, or use the client's address as an identifier.
   - Maintain a list or dictionary of clients to keep track of active connections.

5. **Message Relaying**: 
   - Receive messages from clients, process them as needed (e.g., checking for commands or managing user lists), and then relay those messages to other clients.
   - Implement a protocol for your messages, such as JSON, to structure the data being sent and received.

6. **Building the Client Application**: 
   - The client application will also use the `socket` library to connect to the server.
   - It should have a user interface for inputting and displaying messages.
   - The client handles sending messages to the server and receiving messages from the server.

7. **Shutting Down**: 
   - Provide a way for the server to gracefully shut down, closing all client connections and releasing resources.

### Enhanced Client

Client-side features can greatly enhance the user experience by making the chat application more interactive and user-friendly. Here are some features you could consider developing for the chat client:

1. **User Interface (UI) Enhancements**:
   - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like `tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy`.
   - Display user list in the chat so participants can see who is online.
   - Use colors and fonts to differentiate between system messages, your messages, and others' messages.

2. **Message Notifications**:
   - Add desktop notifications for new messages when the chat window is not in focus.
   - Implement sound notifications for incoming messages.

3. **Direct Messages (DM)**:
   - Allow users to send private messages to each other.
   - Use a command like `/dm username message` to send a direct message.

4. **File Sharing**:
   - Enable users to share files through the chat.
   - Implement file transfer using sockets to send binary data.

5. **Emoji and Stickers Support**:
   - Allow users to send emojis and stickers.
   - Translate certain text patterns into emojis (e.g., `:)` to ðŸ™‚).

6. **Command Shortcuts**:
   - Implement shortcuts for frequently used commands.
   - For example, `/q` could be a shortcut for `/quit`.

7. **Message Formatting**:
   - Support for markdown or simple text formatting (bold, italics, underline).
   - Parse and format the messages on the client side before sending or displaying them.

8. **Chat History**:
   - Store chat history locally and allow users to scroll back through their chat.
   - Add search functionality to the chat history.

9. **Customization Options**:
   - Allow users to customize the chat interface, such as changing the theme or color scheme.
   - Enable font size adjustments for better readability.

10. **Connection Status**:
    - Indicate when the client is connecting, connected, or disconnected from the server.
    - Automatic reconnection attempts on unexpected disconnections.

11. **Security Features**:
    - Encrypt messages before sending them over the network.
    - Implement a user authentication feature upon connection to the server.

12. **Real-time Typing Indicators**:
    - Show an indicator when someone is typing a message.

13. **Message Time Stamps**:
    - Display the time when a message was sent next to the message.

14. **Language Localization**:
    - Support multiple languages and allow users to choose their preferred language for the UI.

15. **User Profiles and Avatars**:
    - Allow users to set up a profile with a username and avatar.

## Examples

### Basic Server

Here is a simplified example of what the server code might look like using sockets and threading:

```python
import socket
import threading

# Server IP and port
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 12345

# Starting the server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((host, port))
server.listen()

# List to keep track of client threads
clients = []
nicknames = []

# Sending messages to all connected clients
def broadcast(message):
    for client in clients:
        client.send(message)

# Handling messages from clients
def handle(client):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client.recv(1024)
            broadcast(message)
        except:
            index = clients.index(client)
            clients.remove(client)
            client.close()
            nickname = nicknames[index]
            broadcast(f'{nickname} left the chat!'.encode('ascii'))
            nicknames.remove(nickname)
            break

# Receiving / listening function
def receive():
    while True:
        client, address = server.accept()
        print(f"Connected with {str(address)}")

        client.send('NICK'.encode('ascii'))
        nickname = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
        nicknames.append(nickname)
        clients.append(client)

        print(f'Nickname of the client is {nickname}!')
        broadcast(f'{nickname} joined the chat!'.encode('ascii'))
        client.send('Connected to the server!'.encode('ascii'))

        thread = threading.Thread(target=handle, args=(client,))
        thread.start()

print("Server is listening...")
receive()
```
### Enhanced Server

Below is an enhanced version of the chat server script with the following additional features:

1. **User Authentication**: Users must log in with a username and password.
2. **Command Handling**: Users can execute commands like `/quit` to disconnect.
3. **Client Handling**: Disconnect clients cleanly on logout or error.

This example assumes that user credentials are stored in a dictionary for simplicity. In a production system, you would use a database and store hashed passwords instead.

```python
import socket
import threading
import re

# Server IP and port
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 12345

# Starting the server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((host, port))
server.listen()

# Dummy user database
users_db = {
    "user1": "password1",
    "user2": "password2"
}

# List to keep track of client threads
clients = []
nicknames = []

# Broadcasting messages to all connected clients
def broadcast(message, _client):
    for client in clients:
        if client != _client:
            client.send(message)

# Handling messages from clients
def handle(client):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client.recv(1024)
            if message.decode('ascii').startswith('/quit'):
                index = clients.index(client)
                clients.remove(client)
                client.close()
                nickname = nicknames[index]
                broadcast(f'{nickname} left the chat!'.encode('ascii'), client)
                nicknames.remove(nickname)
                break
            else:
                broadcast(message, client)
        except:
            continue

# Receiving / Listening function
def receive():
    while True:
        client, address = server.accept()
        print(f"Connected with {str(address)}")

        client.send('NICK'.encode('ascii'))
        nickname = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')

        with threading.Lock():
            if nickname in users_db:
                client.send('PASS'.encode('ascii'))
                password = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')

                if users_db[nickname] == password:
                    clients.append(client)
                    nicknames.append(nickname)
                    print(f'Nickname of the client is {nickname}!')
                    broadcast(f'{nickname} joined the chat!'.encode('ascii'), client)
                    client.send('Connected to the server!'.encode('ascii'))

                    thread = threading.Thread(target=handle, args=(client,))
                    thread.start()
                else:
                    client.send('REFUSE'.encode('ascii'))
                    client.close()
            else:
                client.send('REFUSE'.encode('ascii'))
                client.close()

print("Server is listening...")
receive()
```

In this script, when a client connects, they are asked for a nickname. If the nickname exists in the `users_db` dictionary, they are then asked for a password. If the password matches the one in the `users_db`, they are allowed to join the chat. If not, the connection is refused. The server now also understands a `/quit` command, which allows users to cleanly disconnect from the server.

Keep in mind that this script is still a basic example for learning purposes and lacks many features and security measures required for a production environment, such as encrypted passwords, handling of exceptions and errors, and SSL/TLS encryption for the transmission of data.

### Server with sqlite

To handle user registration and authentication with a SQLite database, you would need to add functionality to the server script to interact with the database. This would include creating tables for storing user credentials, functions for registering new users, and functions for authenticating users during login.

Below is an example script that includes SQLite database integration for user registration and authentication. 

**Note**: This is a simple example for educational purposes. Passwords should never be stored in plain text in a production environment; they should be hashed using a library like `bcrypt`.

```python
import socket
import threading
import sqlite3

# Server IP and port
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 12345

# Initialize SQLite connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('chat_server.db', check_same_thread=False)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create users table if it doesn't exist already
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    password TEXT
)
''')
conn.commit()

# Function to register a new user
def register_new_user(username, password):
    try:
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)', (username, password))
        conn.commit()
        return True
    except sqlite3.IntegrityError:
        return False

# Function to authenticate a user
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    cursor.execute('SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ?', (username,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    if result and result[0] == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Starting the server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((host, port))
server.listen()

# Lists to keep track of clients and nicknames
clients = []
nicknames = []

# Broadcasting messages to all connected clients
def broadcast(message, _client):
    for client in clients:
        if client != _client:
            client.send(message)

# Handling messages from clients
def handle(client):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client.recv(1024)
            broadcast(message, client)
        except:
            # Removing and closing clients
            index = clients.index(client)
            clients.remove(client)
            client.close()
            nickname = nicknames[index]
            broadcast(f'{nickname} left the chat!'.encode('ascii'), client)
            nicknames.remove(nickname)
            break

# Receiving / Listening function
def receive():
    while True:
        client, address = server.accept()
        print(f"Connected with {str(address)}")

        # Registration or Login
        client.send('REGISTER or LOGIN'.encode('ascii'))
        response = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
        
        if response.lower() == 'register':
            client.send('USERNAME'.encode('ascii'))
            username = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            client.send('PASSWORD'.encode('ascii'))
            password = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            
            if register_new_user(username, password):
                client.send('REGISTERED'.encode('ascii'))
            else:
                client.send('USERNAME TAKEN'.encode('ascii'))
                client.close()
                continue

        elif response.lower() == 'login':
            client.send('USERNAME'.encode('ascii'))
            username = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            client.send('PASSWORD'.encode('ascii'))
            password = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            
            if authenticate_user(username, password):
                client.send('LOGGEDIN'.encode('ascii'))
                clients.append(client)
                nicknames.append(username)
                broadcast(f'{username} joined the chat!'.encode('ascii'), client)
                thread = threading.Thread(target=handle, args=(client,))
                thread.start()
            else:
                client.send('LOGIN FAILED'.encode('ascii'))
                client.close()
                continue

        else:
            client.close()

print("Server is listening...")
receive()
```

In this script, when a client connects to the server, they are prompted to either register or log in. If they choose to register, the server asks for a username and password and attempts to add them to the SQLite database. If the username is already taken, the server sends a message back to the client and closes the connection.

If they choose to log in, the server asks for their username and password, checks the credentials against the database, and either allows them to join the chat or closes the connection if the login fails.

Remember, this is just an illustrative example. For a real-world application, you'd need to implement proper error handling, secure password storage with hashing, and potentially more sophisticated user management.

### Server with history

To store chat history and allow users to search through it, we need to modify the chat server to include database operations for storing messages and querying the chat history. Below is a simplified example using SQLite. The server stores each message in the database and provides a command to search the history.

First, you'll need a table to store the messages:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    message TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Next, we'll include the necessary functions in the chat server script to insert messages into this table and to search through the messages.

```python
import sqlite3
import socket
import threading
from datetime import datetime

# Database setup
conn = sqlite3.connect('chat_server.db', check_same_thread=False)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
                  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                  username TEXT,
                  message TEXT,
                  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)''')
conn.commit()

# Function to store messages
def store_message(username, message):
    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO messages (username, message) VALUES (?, ?)', (username, message))
    conn.commit()

# Function to search messages
def search_messages(query):
    cursor.execute('SELECT username, message, timestamp FROM messages WHERE message LIKE ?', ('%'+query+'%',))
    return cursor.fetchall()

# ... existing chat server code ...

# Modify the handle function to store messages
def handle(client, username):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            # Store the message
            store_message(username, message)
            # Check for search command
            if message.startswith('/search'):
                _, query = message.split(' ', 1)
                search_results = search_messages(query)
                search_results = '\n'.join([f"{timestamp} {user}: {msg}" for user, msg, timestamp in search_results])
                client.send(search_results.encode('ascii'))
            else:
                broadcast(message.encode('ascii'), username + ": ")
        except:
            # Code to remove and close clients in case of an error
            # ...
            break

# ... existing chat server code ...

# Modify the receive function to pass the username to the handle function
def receive():
    while True:
        # ... existing connection handling code ...
        
        # Pass the username to the handle function
        thread = threading.Thread(target=handle, args=(client, username))
        thread.start()

# ... existing chat server code ...
```

In the modified `handle` function, every message received from a client is stored in the database using the `store_message` function. When the server receives a command starting with `/search`, it uses the `search_messages` function to find all messages containing the query string.

When testing and running this script, make sure to handle concurrency properly if you're expecting multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously. SQLite works well for lightweight applications with not too much concurrent writing, but for more demanding applications, a more robust database system like PostgreSQL would be advisable.

Also, consider adding proper error handling, validation, and security measures, especially around the search functionality, to prevent potential misuse of the search feature.

### Basic Client

This example demonstrates the server side of a chat application. You'll need a corresponding client-side application that can connect to this server, send messages, and display the chat stream. Remember to handle exceptions and errors gracefully in a production environment.

Below is a simple example of a client application that can connect to the server you set up. This client uses Python's `socket` and `threading` libraries to handle communication with the server.

```python
import socket
import threading

# Choosing Nickname
nickname = input("Choose your nickname: ")

# Connecting To Server
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
host = '127.0.0.1'  # The server's hostname or IP address
port = 12345        # The port used by the server

# Attempt to connect to the server
try:
    client.connect((host, port))
except ConnectionRefusedError:
    print("Unable to connect to the server.")
    exit()

# Listening to Server and Sending Nickname
def receive():
    while True:
        try:
            # Receive message from server
            # If 'NICK' is received, send the nickname
            message = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            if message == 'NICK':
                client.send(nickname.encode('ascii'))
            else:
                print(message)
        except:
            # Close Connection When Error
            print("An error occurred!")
            client.close()
            break

# Sending Messages To Server
def write():
    while True:
        message = f'{nickname}: {input("")}'
        client.send(message.encode('ascii'))

# Starting Threads For Listening and Writing
receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive)
receive_thread.start()

write_thread = threading.Thread(target=write)
write_thread.start()
```

Here's how this client application works:

- When started, it asks the user for a nickname.
- It then attempts to connect to the server using the specified `host` and `port`.
- Once connected, it starts two threads:
  - One thread (`receive_thread`) is responsible for listening to messages from the server and printing them to the console.
  - The other thread (`write_thread`) allows the user to type messages which are then sent to the server.

Keep in mind that this is a very basic example. A full implementation should include error handling, disconnection handling, and a user-friendly interface. Additionally, for a real-world application, you should consider security aspects, such as encrypting the communication with SSL/TLS.

### Client with Tkinter

Here is a basic example of how you could implement a user list display in a `tkinter` GUI:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext

# ... Other client code ...

class ChatClient(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Chat Client")

        self.chat_display = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(self, state='disabled')
        self.chat_display.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2)

        self.user_list = tk.Listbox(self)
        self.user_list.grid(row=0, column=2, sticky='nsew')

        self.msg_entry = tk.Entry(self)
        self.msg_entry.grid(row=1, column=0, columnspan=3, sticky='ew')

        self.send_button = tk.Button(self, text="Send", command=self.send_message)
        self.send_button.grid(row=2, column=1, sticky='ew')

    def send_message(self):
        # Function to send message to the server
        pass

    def update_user_list(self, user_list):
        self.user_list.delete(0, tk.END)
        for user in user_list:
            self.user_list.insert(tk.END, user)

# Run the chat client
if __name__ == '__main__':
    client = ChatClient()
    client.mainloop()
```

### Tkinter setup example

To create a comprehensive `tkinter` UI for a chat client, consider including the following components and features:

1. **Chat Display Area**: A text area to display incoming and outgoing messages.
2. **Message Input Area**: An entry widget for typing messages.
3. **Send Button**: A button to send messages.
4. **User List Display**: A list to display online users.
5. **Connect/Disconnect Buttons**: To manage the chat connection.
6. **Login Panel**: To enter username and password for connection.
7. **Status Bar**: To show connection status and notifications.
8. **Menu Bar**: With options like 'File', 'Edit', 'Help', etc.
9. **Formatting Buttons**: To apply text formatting like bold or italics.
10. **File Transfer**: To send and receive files.
11. **Settings**: To configure client options like notifications, appearance, etc.

Here's an outline of how the UI could be structured using `tkinter`:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext, messagebox, filedialog

class ChatClient(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Chat Client")
        self.geometry("800x600")  # Set starting size of window

        self.create_menu()
        self.create_chat_display()
        self.create_message_input()
        self.create_user_list()
        self.create_status_bar()

    def create_menu(self):
        menu_bar = tk.Menu(self)
        
        file_menu = tk.Menu(menu_bar, tearoff=0)

        file_menu.add_command(label="Disconnect", command=self.disconnect)
        file_menu.add_separator()
        file_menu.add_command(label="Exit", command=self.exit_app)
        
        edit_menu = tk.Menu(menu_bar, tearoff=0)
        edit_menu.add_command(label="Settings", command=self.open_settings)
        
        help_menu = tk.Menu(menu_bar, tearoff=0)
        help_menu.add_command(label="About", command=self.show_about)

        menu_bar.add_cascade(label="File", menu=file_menu)
        menu_bar.add_cascade(label="Edit", menu=edit_menu)
        menu_bar.add_cascade(label="Help", menu=help_menu)
        
        self.config(menu=menu_bar)

    def create_chat_display(self):
        self.chat_display = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(self, state='disabled', wrap='word')
        self.chat_display.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, sticky="nsew")
        
        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)

    def create_message_input(self):
        self.msg_entry = tk.Entry(self)
        self.msg_entry.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky="ew")

        send_button = tk.Button(self, text="Send", command=self.send_message)
        send_button.grid(row=1, column=1, sticky="ew")

    def create_user_list(self):
        self.user_list = tk.Listbox(self)
        self.user_list.grid(row=0, column=2, sticky="nsew")

    def create_status_bar(self):
        self.status_bar = tk.Label(self, text="Disconnected", bd=1, relief=tk.SUNKEN, anchor=tk.W)
        self.status_bar.grid(row=2, column=0, columnspan=3, sticky="we")

    def send_message(self):
        # Code to send the message to the server
        pass

    def connect(self):
        # Code to connect to the chat server
        pass

    def disconnect(self):
        # Code to disconnect from the chat server
        pass

    def show_about(self):
        messagebox.showinfo("About", "Chat Client\nCreated with tkinter.")

    def exit_app(self):
        self.quit()

    def open_settings(self):
        # Code to open settings window
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    client = ChatClient()
    client.mainloop()
```

This script sets up the main window with a menu bar, chat display, message input, user list, and status bar. Each method in the `ChatClient` class corresponds to a part of the UI and is responsible for creating and laying out that component. The `send_message`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `show_about`, `exit_app`, and `open_settings` methods are placeholders where you would add the functionality for each action.

This outline provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive chat client UI. The actual implementation of the functionalities will require more detailed coding, event handling, and networking logic.

In this example, the `ChatClient` class creates a simple GUI with a chat display, a user list, a message entry, and a send button. You would need to integrate the networking code that connects to the server, receives messages, updates the chat display, and maintains the user list.

Remember, as you add features, keep user privacy and data security in mind. Always test new features thoroughly to ensure they enhance the user experience without introducing new bugs or vulnerabilities.

## Enhancements

### Design Patterns

Design patterns can significantly enhance the structure and maintainability of code. In the context of your chat server and client applications, several design patterns could be applied:

1. **Command Pattern**:
   - For parsing and executing different types of messages or commands received from the client.
   - This would separate the command logic from the main communication logic.

2. **Observer Pattern**:
   - The server can use this pattern to notify all connected clients (observers) of new messages or events.
   - In the client, this pattern could be used to update the chat UI whenever a new message is received.

3. **Factory Pattern**:
   - If you extend the client application to handle different types of communication or message formats, a factory pattern could provide a way to create different parser objects based on the message type.

4. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - The server configuration (like IP address and port) could be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the configuration exists throughout the application's lifecycle.

5. **Decorator Pattern**:
   - To add additional behaviors to the communication channels dynamically. For example, you could use decorators to add encryption or compression to the messages being sent and received.

6. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - This could be used to change the algorithm of how messages are processed or how the connection is handled without affecting the client class that uses the algorithm.

7. **State Pattern**:
   - For managing the state of the connection (e.g., connected, disconnected, reconnecting) in a more organized manner.

8. **Template Method Pattern**:
   - Define a skeleton of the operations to execute a series of steps, like setting up a connection or sending a message, and let the subclasses redefine certain steps without changing the structure of the algorithm.

By applying these design patterns, you could make the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, especially as the complexity of the application grows. Each pattern serves a different purpose, so the choice of patterns should be based on the specific challenges you're facing in the development process.

### Client message formatting

Implementing message formatting on the client side can be done by allowing users to input text with certain patterns or symbols that represent formatting commands (similar to markdown). The client application can then parse these commands and format the messages accordingly before displaying them.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement basic text formatting for bold (`**bold**`) and italics (`*italics*`) in a chat client using Python's regular expressions module:

```python
import re
from tkinter import *

# Define regular expressions for bold and italics
bold_pattern = re.compile(r'\*\*(.*?)\*\*')
italics_pattern = re.compile(r'\*(.*?)\*')

def apply_formatting(message):
    # Replace markdown-like patterns with tkinter's tags
    formatted_message = message
    bold_ranges = [(m.start(1), m.end(1)) for m in re.finditer(bold_pattern, message)]
    italics_ranges = [(m.start(1), m.end(1)) for m in re.finditer(italics_pattern, message)]
    
    # Sort ranges in reverse order to not mess up indices while replacing
    for start, end in sorted(bold_ranges + italics_ranges, reverse=True):
        formatted_message = formatted_message[:start] + formatted_message[start:end] + formatted_message[end:]

    return formatted_message, bold_ranges, italics_ranges

def add_message_to_chatbox(chatbox, message):
    # Apply formatting
    formatted_message, bold_ranges, italics_ranges = apply_formatting(message)
    
    # Insert the message into the chatbox
    chatbox.configure(state='normal')
    start_index = chatbox.index('end')
    chatbox.insert('end', formatted_message + '\n')
    end_index = chatbox.index('end')
    
    # Apply bold tag where needed
    for start, end in bold_ranges:
        chatbox.tag_add('bold', f"{start_index}+{start}c", f"{start_index}+{end}c")
    
    # Apply italics tag where needed
    for start, end in italics_ranges:
        chatbox.tag_add('italics', f"{start_index}+{start}c", f"{start_index}+{end}c")

    chatbox.configure(state='disabled')

# GUI Setup
root = Tk()
chatbox = Text(root, wrap='word')
chatbox.tag_configure('bold', font=('Arial', 10, 'bold'))
chatbox.tag_configure('italics', font=('Arial', 10, 'italic'))
chatbox.pack()

# Add a formatted message
add_message_to_chatbox(chatbox, "This is **bold** and this is *italics*.")

root.mainloop()
```

This script uses `re` to find sequences in the text that are marked for formatting. When it inserts the message into the `Text` widget, it then applies the `bold` and `italics` tags to the respective ranges. The tags are defined with corresponding font configurations to reflect the formatting.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example. For more complex markdown-like formatting, you might need a more sophisticated parser. Also, this implementation only considers non-overlapping formatting for simplicity. Overlapping formatting (e.g., `**bold and *italics* text**`) is more complex to handle and would require a more robust parsing and rendering approach.

### More parsing

For more complex parsing, including nested formatting like bold within italics or vice versa, you would typically use a parsing library or write a custom parser that can handle such cases. Below is an example using Python's standard `re` module to handle non-overlapping and overlapping bold and italics markdown-like syntax. 

The following code will be an extension of the previous example, improving the parsing of the formatted text:

```python
import re
from tkinter import *

# Define patterns for markdown-like bold and italics
bold_pattern = re.compile(r'\*\*(.*?)\*\*')
italics_pattern = re.compile(r'\*(.*?)\*')

def apply_complex_formatting(text_widget, message, start='1.0'):
    """
    Applies complex formatting to the given message and inserts it into the text widget.
    Supports overlapping and non-overlapping bold and italics.
    """
    # Escape special characters in tags
    message = message.replace("&", "&amp;").replace("<", "&lt;").replace(">", "&gt;")
    
    # Search for all formatting patterns
    formatting_spans = []
    for match in bold_pattern.finditer(message):
        formatting_spans.append((match.start(), match.end(), 'bold', match.group(1)))
    for match in italics_pattern.finditer(message):
        formatting_spans.append((match.start(), match.end(), 'italics', match.group(1)))

    # Sort spans by start index
    formatting_spans.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Remove markdown and apply tags
    last_end = 0
    for start_idx, end_idx, tag, content in formatting_spans:
        # Insert plain text before formatted span
        if start_idx > last_end:
            plain_text = message[last_end:start_idx]
            text_widget.insert('end', plain_text)
        
        # Insert the formatted text and apply the tag
        text_widget.insert('end', content)
        content_start = text_widget.index(f"{start}+{text_widget.index('end')} - {len(content)} chars")
        text_widget.tag_add(tag, content_start, f"{content_start} + {len(content)} chars")
        last_end = end_idx  # Update last_end to the end of the current span

    # Insert any remaining plain text after the last formatted span
    if last_end < len(message):
        plain_text = message[last_end:]
        text_widget.insert('end', plain_text)

    text_widget.insert('end', '\n')  # Move to next line after inserting message

# GUI Setup
root = Tk()
chatbox = Text(root, wrap='word', font=('Arial', 10))
chatbox.tag_configure('bold', font=('Arial', 10, 'bold'))
chatbox.tag_configure('italics', font=('Arial', 10, 'italic'))
chatbox.pack()

# Insert a message with complex formatting
message = "This is **bold**, this is *italics*, and this is **bold and *nested italics* together**!"
chatbox.config(state='normal')
apply_complex_formatting(chatbox, message)
chatbox.config(state='disabled')

root.mainloop()
```

In this updated function `apply_complex_formatting`, we are parsing both bold and italic patterns, sorting them to maintain the order they appear in the text, and applying tags accordingly. The code handles overlapping styles by applying tags for bold and italics separately, even when they are nested.

The Tkinter `Text` widget allows us to add multiple tags to the same range of text, which makes it possible to have nested formatting. This approach, however, is quite rudimentary and may not handle all edge cases of markdown-like syntax. A full markdown parser typically uses a parsing tree to handle nested and complex formatting correctly. If you need more advanced markdown support, you might want to look into libraries like `markdown2` or `Mistune` that can convert markdown to HTML, which you could then render in a more capable widget that supports HTML, or adapt their parsing techniques to work directly with Tkinter text tags.

## Deployment

Hosting the chat server remotely and allowing HTTP connections from authenticated clients involves several steps. Here's an overview of how you might do this, with a focus on authentication and remote hosting:

1. **Choose a Hosting Environment**:
   - Select a cloud provider or a remote hosting service where you can deploy your server application.

2. **Server Setup for HTTP**:
   - Modify the server to handle HTTP requests. You can use the `http.server` or `flask` library for a more feature-rich application.
   - Ensure the server listens on a public IP address or hostname provided by the hosting service.

3. **Secure the Connection**:
   - Implement SSL/TLS to encrypt the data transmission. This could involve using a library like `ssl` to wrap your server's socket.
   - Obtain an SSL certificate, which can be a free one from Let's Encrypt or a paid one from another certificate authority.

4. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Create an authentication system that requires clients to provide credentials before they can send messages.
   - For a simple HTTP-based auth, you can use HTTP Basic Auth; for more security, consider using tokens like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) which can be implemented using additional libraries like `PyJWT`.
   - Store and manage user credentials securely, ideally using a database and hashing passwords with a library like `bcrypt`.

5. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Configure the server's firewall to allow incoming connections on the HTTP port (typically port 80, or 443 for HTTPS).

6. **Address-Based Filtering**:
   - Implement IP filtering to allow or block requests based on the client's IP address.
   - This could be part of your application logic or could be set up as part of the firewall settings on your server.

7. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Deploy your server application to the remote host.
   - Start the application and ensure it's running as a background service, using tools like `systemd`, `supervisor`, or `screen`.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement basic token authentication in a Flask-based server:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, abort
from functools import wraps

app = Flask(__name__)

# Dummy user database
users = {
    "user1": "password1",
    "user2": "password2"
}

# Dummy method to create and validate tokens
def create_token(username):
    return username[::-1]  # Simple reversal of username as a token, for example purposes only

def verify_token(token):
    username = token[::-1]  # Reversing the token to get the username
    return username in users

# Authentication decorator
def require_auth(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
        if not token or not verify_token(token):
            abort(401)
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth
def chat():
    # Here you would handle incoming chat messages
    return jsonify({"message": "Message received"})

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    if username in users and users[username] == password:
        token = create_token(username)
        return jsonify({"token": token})
    else:
        abort(401)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')  # 'adhoc' will create a self-signed cert
```

This example uses Flask, a Python web framework, to create a server with a login route that returns a token. The chat route is protected by the `require_auth` decorator, which requires a valid token to be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request.

**Please Note**: This example is simplified and not suitable for production use. Token handling here is just a placeholder; you should use a proper authentication mechanism like JWT, and never store passwords in plain text. Always follow best practices for security, especially when dealing with user authentication and data.

### Google Cloud Services

To deploy your chat server using Docker and Google Cloud Services (GCS), you would need to follow these general steps:

1. **Write a Dockerfile**:
   Create a Dockerfile to define how your chat server application will be built into a Docker image. It should contain all the necessary commands to assemble the image.

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Use the Docker CLI to build an image from your Dockerfile.

3. **Test the Docker Image Locally**:
   Run your image as a container locally to make sure it works correctly.

4. **Push the Docker Image to Google Container Registry (GCR)**:
   Tag your Docker image and push it to GCR, which is a private container image registry that runs on Google Cloud.

5. **Deploy the Container on Google Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**:
   Use Google Cloud Run for a simpler deployment if you don't need the orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes, or use GKE if you need more control over the deployment.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### 1. Write a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project with the following content (assuming your server script is named `chat_server.py`):

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 12345 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 12345

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME ChatServer

# Run chat_server.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "chat_server.py"]
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

```sh
docker build -t chat-server-image .
```

### 3. Test the Docker Image Locally

```sh
docker run -p 12345:12345 chat-server-image
```

### 4. Push the Docker Image to GCR

First, tag your image with the registry name:

```sh
docker tag chat-server-image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/chat-server-image
```

Then, push it to GCR:

```sh
docker push gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/chat-server-image
```

Make sure you have configured `gcloud` command-line tool and authenticated Docker to push to Google's repository:

```sh
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

### 5. Deploy the Container on Google Cloud Run or GKE

For **Google Cloud Run**:

Use the Cloud Console or the `gcloud` CLI to deploy the image from GCR to Cloud Run:

```sh
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/chat-server-image --platform managed
```

For **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**:

Create a Kubernetes deployment that specifies your container image:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: chat-server-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: chat-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chat-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: chat-server
        image: gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/chat-server-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 12345
```

Save this to a file named `deployment.yaml` and apply it with `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Then, expose it with a service:

```sh
kubectl expose deployment chat-server-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port 12345
```

Remember to replace `[PROJECT-ID]` with your actual Google Cloud project ID. The steps provided are a high-level guide; specific commands and configurations might change based on the exact requirements of your application and the Google Cloud environment. Always refer to the latest Google Cloud documentation for the most accurate information.

### Docker with DB

When deploying a Docker container that requires persistent storage, such as for an SQLite database, you should use a volume to ensure that the data persists across container restarts and redeployments. Here's how you can modify the Docker and deployment process to include the SQLite database:

### Dockerfile

You should modify the Dockerfile to create a directory for your database file. It's good practice not to store the database in the root of your project to avoid accidentally overwriting it when you rebuild the image.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Create a directory for the SQLite database
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app/db

# Make port 12345 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 12345

# Define environment variable for the database path
ENV SQLITE_DB_PATH /usr/src/app/db/chat_server.db

# Use a volume for the db directory
VOLUME ["/usr/src/app/db"]

# Run chat_server.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "chat_server.py"]
```

### Docker Run for Local Testing

When you run the container locally, you can map a local directory to the volume you've defined in the Dockerfile. This will store your SQLite database in your local directory, which will persist data across container restarts.

```sh
docker run -p 12345:12345 -v "$(pwd)/db:/usr/src/app/db" chat-server-image
```

This command maps a local `db` directory to the `/usr/src/app/db` directory in the container.

### Google Cloud Run

Cloud Run is stateless, and it does not support persistent volumes. If you need to store data persistently with Cloud Run, you would typically use a managed database service like Google Cloud SQL. However, if you only need to store ephemeral data for the duration of the container's life (which may be short and is not guaranteed), you can still write to the container's filesystem.

For a stateful application like a chat server, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Compute Engine would be a better fit as they support persistent volumes.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

With GKE, you can use persistent volumes to store your SQLite database. You would define a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in your deployment to request persistent storage from GKE, and then mount this storage into your pod.

Here's an example of a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: sqlite-db-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

And then in your deployment file, you would reference this PVC and mount it to your pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: chat-server-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: chat-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chat-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: chat-server
        image: gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/chat-server-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 12345
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/src/app/db"
          name: sqlite-storage
      volumes:
      - name: sqlite-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: sqlite-db-claim
```

By using a PVC, the data in your SQLite database will be preserved even if the pods are deleted or moved to another node.

In all cases, ensure you handle SQLite database connections carefully to avoid file locks or corruption, especially in environments where multiple instances of your application might be running concurrently, as SQLite might not be the best choice for such scenarios. A more robust solution like PostgreSQL with a proper managed database service is recommended for production environments.

## SQL stuff

You can use Python's formatted string literals (also known as f-strings) to make SQL statements more readable. However, you should be very careful when doing so because f-strings can introduce the risk of SQL injection if you're not cautious with how you include variables within your SQL statements. It's crucial never to include untrusted input directly in these strings.


For static queries or queries where parameters are not directly included in the string, f-strings can make your SQL more readable. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
# Define your SQL statements as constants with placeholders
SQL_CREATE_MESSAGES_TABLE = f"""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    message TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
"""

# Now, use these constants in your functions
def initialize_database():
    cursor.execute(SQL_CREATE_MESSAGES_TABLE)
    conn.commit()
```

For queries that require dynamic data, you should use parameter substitution provided by the SQLite library to safely include variables. This way, you avoid SQL injection risks. Here's how you can refactor the code to use parameter substitution correctly:

```python
# Define your SQL statements as constants with placeholders
SQL_INSERT_MESSAGE = "INSERT INTO messages (username, message) VALUES (?, ?)"
SQL_SEARCH_MESSAGES = "SELECT username, message, timestamp FROM messages WHERE message LIKE ?"

# Function to store messages using safe parameter substitution
def store_message(username, message):
    cursor.execute(SQL_INSERT_MESSAGE, (username, message))
    conn.commit()

# Function to search messages using safe parameter substitution
def search_messages(query):
    cursor.execute(SQL_SEARCH_MESSAGES, ('%'+query+'%',))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

In the `store_message` and `search_messages` functions, the `?` placeholders are replaced by the `username` and `message` parameters securely by the SQLite library itself, which prevents SQL injection even if `username` or `message` includes SQL syntax.

Always remember, for any dynamic SQL statement where you're including external data (like user input), you should use the parameter substitution method to ensure your application's security. Avoid using f-strings or other forms of string interpolation for these scenarios.

## Test stuff

Writing unit tests for a chat server involves testing the various functionalities in isolation, such as message broadcasting, user registration, authentication, message storage, and history retrieval. Below are example unit tests using Python's `unittest` framework.

We assume that the server's functionalities are modularized into functions or classes. We'll create mock objects and patch the necessary parts where network and database interactions occur.

Here's an example of what the unit test file might look like:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from chat_server import store_message, search_messages, register_new_user, authenticate_user

class TestChatServer(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('chat_server.sqlite3.connect')
    def test_store_message(self, mock_db_conn):
        """
        Test that storing a message calls the database with the correct SQL
        """
        mock_cursor = mock_db_conn().cursor()
        store_message('testuser', 'Hello, World!')
        mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with(
            'INSERT INTO messages (username, message) VALUES (?, ?)',
            ('testuser', 'Hello, World!')
        )

    @patch('chat_server.sqlite3.connect')
    def test_search_messages(self, mock_db_conn):
        """
        Test that searching messages calls the database with the correct SQL
        """

In this file, `chat_server` is the module where your chat server functions are defined. The `@patch` decorator from `unittest.mock` is used to replace the `sqlite3.connect` method with a mock, so that you don't interact with a real database during testing.

The tests check whether the correct SQL statements are executed with the expected parameters. The `test_user_registration` checks if a new user is inserted into the database, while `test_user_authentication` checks if the user is authenticated correctly.

Before running these tests, make sure that your actual `chat_server` module contains the appropriate functions (`store_message`, `search_messages`, `register_new_user`, `authenticate_user`) with the expected parameters.

These tests are very basic and intended to demonstrate the concept of unit testing in Python. You may need to adjust the tests to fit the actual implementation of your server functions, especially if you're using an ORM or other database management system.
